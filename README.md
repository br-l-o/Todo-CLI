# TODO-CLI

I needed to learn some F#, so I made a few small apps to do such a thing.

The code is ugly, and probably as fragile as my ego, but it works!

### Does it actually work?
Sure! I've tested it on Windows 10, Windows 11, and Ubuntu 20.04 (targeting .NET 5) and it works as expected on all platforms!
